idnkit internally uses Unicode codepoint tables derived from Unicode
Character Database and IDNA2008-Tables.  This version of idnkit
supports:

   Unicode: 6.3.0
   IDNA2008-Tables: updated 2011-11-14

You can build idnkit with the tables of different versions.
This document describes how to generate the tables of other versions.


** How to generate Unicode codepoint tables.			

0. Get data files for Unicode Character Database of a particular
   version you would like to use for idnkit. You can obtain the data
   file from:
      http://www.unicode.org/ucd/

   At least, the following data files are required:

      UnicodeData.txt
      SpecialCasing.txt
      CompositionExclusions.txt
      ArabicShaping.txt
      Scripts.txt
      DerivedCoreProperties.txt

1. Get data files for UTS #46 of a particular Unicode version.
   You can obtain the data file from:

	http://www.unicode.org/Public/idna/

   At least, the following data files are required:

	IdnaMappingTable.txt

   Please note that versions of data files for Unicode Character
   Database and UTS #46 should be the same.

2. Place the data files for Unicode Character Database and UTS #46
   in the 'data' sub directory.  (You may choose another directory.
   See the next section.)

3. Go to the 'utils' sub directory and type:	

      ./generate_unicodeall.sh UNICODE-VERSION

   where UNICODE-VERSION is a version ID of Unicode Character Database
   and UTS #46 ("6.0.0" for Unicode 6.0.0, for example). If you have put
   the data files somewhere else than '../data', specify its location
   using '-datadir' option.	

      ./generate_unicodeall.sh -datadir /somewhere/else UNICODE-VERSION

   Upon success, the script outputs the messages below.
   
      ** Generate Unicode version file
      ** Generate Bidi class table
      ** Generate Cased table
      ** Generate Case_Ignorable table
      ** Generate Combining character table
      ** Generate Combining class table
      ** Generate Composition table
      ** Generate Decomposition table
      ** Generate Joining type table
      ** Generate Lowercase table
      ** Generate Script table
      ** Generate TR #46 casefold table
      ** Generate TR #46 validation table
      ** Generate Width table
      ** Complete

   C program files are created in '../lib/auto' and header files are
   generated in '../include/idn/auto'. Compiling idnkit according with
   description of the INSTALL file, the generated tables are used.

** How to generate IDNA property table.			

0. Get an XML edition of the IDNA Parameters file you would like
   to use with idnkit. You can obtain the file from:

     http://www.iana.org/assignments/idna-tables/idna-tables.xml

   To generate a table for idnkit, XML::Simple Perl package is required.

1. Place 'idnabis-tables.xml' file in the 'data' sub directory.
   (You may choose another directory. See the next section.)

2. Go to the 'utils' sub directory and type:

      ./generate_idnaall.sh IDNA-VERSION

   where IDNA-VERSION is a version ID of the IDNA table like 
   "rfc6452 (2011-11-14)".  If you have put the data file somewhere
   else than '../data', specify its location using '-datadir' option.

      ./generate_idnaall.sh -datadir /somewhere/else IDNA-VERSION

   Upon success, the script outputs the messages below.

      ** Generate IDNA version file
      ** Generate IDNA category table
      ** Complete
   
   C program files are created in '../lib/auto' and header files are
   generated in '../include/idn/auto'. Compiling idnkit according with
   description of the INSTALL file, the generated tables are used.
